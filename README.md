# Brain_Tumor_Classifier
This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify brain MRI images into four categories:
   *Glioma
   *Meningioma
   *Pituitary
   *No Tumor
The model is trained on MRI scan datasets, preprocessed to ensure consistency in image size, format, and quality.
It aims to assist in early detection of brain tumors.
